Hi, I'm YingTing, a second-year master's student in Statistics at the University of Chicago. My academic journey has been driven by a strong passion for data science, machine learning and statistical modeling. I enjoy exploring the theoretical foundations of machine learning while applying various techniques to real-world problems.

Before joining UChicago, I worked as a data analyst at Lenovo, where I specialized in SQL, Power BI. Collaborating with cross-functional teams gave me valuable insights into strategic and creative problem-solving.

Currently, I am focused on analyzing financial data using machine learning models to uncover meaningful patterns. I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge in data science.

Outside of work and studies, I love traveling and experiencing different cultures, which enhances my adaptability and teamwork skills.

Feel free to connect with me! Iâ€™d love to exchange ideas and collaborate on exciting data projects!
